                                    I was responsible for teaching 37 students the basics of computer science. These students were from different non CS backgrounds and i had the

                                    In this course, I was responsible for taking the labs. The labs mainly focused on teaching them some of the basic concepts of java involving the 4 pillars 
                                    of java polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation also focus on access modifiers, different keywords such as super, this and many more. 
                                    Furthermore, me and my colleague were responsible to ensure that the students where understanding what's happening behind the scenes going to each and everyone and solving their problems.

                                    Furthermore, helping them understand and implement different scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, SJF, SRJF, Bankers, and many more.

                                    diagrams such as DFD, Class Diagram, Feseability Analysis, and many more. Finally, we had to judge them based on their overall performance and the final project.

                                    method problems using python.

                                the university pressure, how to study, where to get resources and so on.

                        Brac University mainly focuses on Java as the main language for helping the students understand logic behind programming. However,
                        They dont focus on learning frameworks related to it. Currently i have no projects to show regarding java however my git 
                        page has problems that might show my Knowledge regarding this. My Knowledge related to java and programming are limited to the following,
                        4 pillars of Java, Data Types, Control Statements, Data Structures, Algorithms, use Hibernate, Spring MVC etc. <br>

                        This is a new language im persuring right now. Even though had done a course CSE391: Programming For the internet
                        where we had to do a few challenges related to JS but that was on a very basic level. However, now im focusing
                        on DOM manipulation with vanilla JS and jQuery and moving on to learning frameworks such such Node.js, Express.js and Vue.js. Wish me luck!! 

                        I have a few projects to show which are definetly not much as you might expect but i tried (Yay?)!
                        <ul id="projects">
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/MarufMonem/JavaScript-Challenges"> CSE391 JS challenges</a></li>
                            <p>This is a small web app (I guess you can say that?) which was my first introduction to JS where i made small calucation and DOM manipulation</p>

                            <p>This project is a fun one related to using JQuery, Paper JS and Howler JS. </p>

                       This is the first 2 things that got me hooked in web development. Made many projects just with the help of HTML CSS however,
                       dont have alot to show for as i lost most of them when my protable HDD crashed (RIP). Anyways, the projects above are wriiten in HTML as the backbone
                       so that tells that i know something about it. I have Knowledge regarding use of Bootstrap 4 and Semantic UI.
