                        in. I was appointed as a faculty
                        of the computer science department under the school of data and science, Brac University. I was
                        responsible for taking 4 labs (L) and 1 theory course (T).

                            I was responsible for teaching 37 students the basics of computer science. These students
                            were from different non CS backgrounds and i had the
                            honour to help them know the wonderful and fasinating world of technology.

                            In this course, I was responsible for taking the labs. The labs mainly focused on teaching
                            them some of the basic concepts of java involving the 4 pillars
                            of java polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation also focus on access
                            modifiers, different keywords such as super, this and many more.
                            Furthermore, me and my colleague were responsible to ensure that the students where
                            understanding what's happening behind the scenes going to each and everyone and solving
                            their problems.

                            In this lab, I was responsible for making them understand different bash commands and what
                            we can do with it.
                            Furthermore, helping them understand and implement different scheduling algorithms such as
                            FCFS, SJF, SRJF, Bankers, and many more.

                            This was according to me the best lab as it was more related to real-life scenarios.
                            In the lab, I with my colleague were responsible for monitoring the students' performance
                            related to their project work which involved helping them understand
                            different project related
                            diagrams such as DFD, Class Diagram, Feseability Analysis, and many more. Finally, we had to
                            judge them based on their overall performance and the final project.

                            In this lab, we had to help the students understand how python works on a very basic level
                            and then introduce them to solve different numerical
                            method problems using python.

                        However, I always felt something lacking in the relevant videos. When I got the student-tutor job I thought 
                        rather than these students matching their schedules with me why not I teach them online. 
                        Thus the start of the channel. I make CS-related content here mostly theoretical concepts.

                        to get accustomed to the environment. I was responsible for 2 batches with a total of 80+
                        students whom I had to guide on how to cope with
                        the university pressure, how to study, where to get resources and so on.

                        Brac University mainly focuses on Java as the main language for helping the students understand
                        logic behind programming. However,
                        They dont focus on learning frameworks related to it. Currently i have no projects to show
                        regarding java however my git
                        page has problems that might show my Knowledge regarding this. My Knowledge related to java and
                        programming are limited to the following,
                        4 pillars of Java, Data Types, Control Statements, Data Structures, Algorithms, use Hibernate,
                        Spring MVC etc.Find few of my java content below.

                        This is a new language im persuring right now. Even though had done a course CSE391: Programming
                        For the internet
                        where we had to do a few challenges related to JS but that was on a very basic level. However,
                        now im focusing
                        on DOM manipulation with vanilla JS and jQuery and moving on to learning frameworks such such
                        Node.js, Express.js and Vue.js. Wish me luck!!

                        I have a few projects to show which are definetly not much as you might expect but i tried
                        (Yay?)!

                        <p>This is a small web app (I guess you can say that?) which was my first introduction to JS
                            where i made small calucation and DOM manipulation</p>

                        <p>This project is a fun one related to using JQuery, Paper JS and Howler JS. </p>

                        This is the first 2 things that got me hooked in web development. Made many projects just with
                        the help of HTML CSS however,
                        dont have alot to show for as i lost most of them when my protable HDD crashed (RIP). Anyways,
                        the projects above are wriiten in HTML as the backbone
                        so that tells that i know something about it. I have Knowledge regarding use of Bootstrap 4 and
                        Semantic UI.

                        My first language-related to backend and I kind of got the hang of it. As I mentioned previously
                        had to learn this for my CSE370:
                        Database and CSE391: Programming for the internet course. I had to go through all of it by
                        myself cause the course expected us to do everything
                        by ourselves! Anyways, I don't have any knowledge regarding PHP frameworks however, I did a
                        large scale project just using raw/vanilla PHP. However,
                        PHP isnt my strong side anymore becuase of the lack of practice.
                    <ul>

                        <p>
                            My first project related to PHP. Very basic level stuff!

                        <p>
                            My first BIG PROJECT! This was for the final submission of my CSE391 course and the reponses
                            towards it were very good.
                            It had all the functions that an actual website would have including login, unauthorized
                            access checker, creating profiles,
                            adding advertisements etc.
